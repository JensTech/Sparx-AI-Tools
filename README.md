# Sparx Reader AI

**Sparx Reader AI** is a super simple Chrome extension designed to help with homework by preparing web content for AI analysis.

It is **not** an LLM itself. Instead, it copies the content of a page and prepares it to be sent to an LLM. It also formats questions with prompts so the AI knows exactly what to do.


## Which LLM Should I Use?

Based on my testing so far:

* **[Gemini by Google](https://gemini.google.com)** – approximately 97% success rate
* **[ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/?temporary-chat=true)** – slightly lower success rate, more prone to errors

If you try another LLM, feel free to open an [issue](https://github.com/JensTech/Sparx-AI-Tools/issues/new) and I’ll add it to this list!
