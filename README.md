# Sparx Reader AI

Sparx reader ai is a super simple chrome 
extension to aid with your homework.

Sparx Reader AI is *NOT* an LLM in itself, it
instead copies the content of the page extract
and prepares it to be sent to an LLM. It also
prepares the questions with prompts injected
into each to tell the ai what to do.

### What LLM do I use?
Based on success rates (what I have tried currently)
- [Gemini by google](https://gemini.google.com) has approximately 97% success rate
- [Chatgpt](https://chatgpt.com/?temporary-chat=true) seems to have a lower success rate with it getting answers wrong more often.

If you try another LLM, feel free to make an issue and i'll add it to this list!
